This script simplifies the process of downloading activities from [Strava](https://www.strava.com/) and uploading them to [TrainingPeaks](https://www.trainingpeaks.com/) in assisted mode.

## How it works

The idea for this script came from the need to synchronize my triathlon training data from my Samsung Watch to TrainingPeaks, a platform not directly compatible with my watch. The script streamlines this process by leveraging Strava as an intermediary.

### Features

- Downloads activities from Strava based on activity IDs.
- Assisted mode for choosing the sport and activity download/upload options.
- Formats TCX files for specific sports like swimming.
- Validates TCX files for running and biking activities.
- Indents TCX files for better readability.

### Workflow

1. Choose the sport you want to export;
2. Do you want to download the `.tcx` file or select from the local directory;
    1. User chooses the ID of the activity on Strava;
    2. The download is performed by accessing the activity route with `/export_original` or `/export_tcx` endpoints;
3. If it is swimming or something else, the `.tcx` file is formatted; if it is running or biking, the `.tcx` file is validated;
4. Indent the `.tcx` file.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. Python 3.6 or higher installed;
2. Pip installed;
3. Logged into your Strava account in your preferred browser.

### Steps

1. Clone the repository;

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lucs1590/strava-to-trainingpeaks
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd strava-to-trainingpeaks
```

3. Install the dependencies;

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Install the package globally;

```bash
pip install .
```

5. Run the project globally;

```bash
strava-to-trainingpeaks
```

## Usage

Follow the on-screen instructions after running the script. You'll be prompted to choose the sport, select activity download options, and provide the file path if necessary.

## Packaging the Application into an Executable

To package the application into an executable using `cx_Freeze`, follow step:

1. Run the following command to create an executable:

```bash
python exec_setup.py build
```

The executable will be created in the `build` directory.

## Running the Project using Docker

To run the project using Docker, follow these steps:

1. Build the Docker image by running the following command in the root directory of the project:

```bash
docker build -t strava-to-trainingpeaks .
```

2. Run the Docker container using the following command:

```bash
docker run -it --rm strava-to-trainingpeaks
```

This will create a Docker container for the project, allowing it to be run in a consistent environment without manual setup.

## Using the Interactive Setup Script

To use the interactive setup script, follow these steps:

1. Run the interactive setup script:

```bash
python interactive_setup.py
```

2. Follow the on-screen instructions to choose your preferred setup method (global installation, virtual environment, Docker).

3. The script will guide you through the installation process, automate virtual environment creation, and install dependencies.

## Synchronization Agent

### Overview

The synchronization agent automates the process of synchronizing all workouts for a given athlete from Strava to TrainingPeaks for an entire week. It uses LangChain to manage synchronization tasks and integrates with Strava and TrainingPeaks APIs.

### Features

- Handles API rate limits with error handling, logging, and scheduling mechanisms.
- Automates synchronization of workouts for an entire week.
- Uses LangChain to manage synchronization tasks.
- Integrates with Strava and TrainingPeaks APIs.
- Optimized for scalability to support multiple athletes.

### Setup

1. Ensure you have the necessary environment variables set up in a `.env` file:

```
STRAVA_API_KEY=your_strava_api_key
TRAININGPEAKS_USERNAME=your_trainingpeaks_username
TRAININGPEAKS_PASSWORD=your_trainingpeaks_password
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the synchronization agent:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

### Usage

The synchronization agent will run the sync process weekly, distributing API requests over time to reduce the likelihood of hitting rate limits. It logs all synchronization attempts and their outcomes for monitoring and debugging purposes.
